Another Conway’s Game Of Life Simulator
================

## Purpose

Simulate some game of life, starting with Conway’s rules. Once the
backbone will be setup :

-   re-find the cyclic non-dying shapes and so on.
-   write some meta-simulation functions to compare life expectancy
    depending on the set of rules and the number of dimensions.

## Todos

-   finalize R logic for simulation and viz
-   decide whether C++ implementation is needed
