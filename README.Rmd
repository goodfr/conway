```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Purpose

Simulate some game of life, starting with Conway's rules. Once the backbone will be setup : 

* re-find the cyclic non-dying shapes and so on.
* write some meta-simulation functions to compare life expectancy depending on the set of rules and the number of dimensions.

## Todos

* finalize R logic for simulation and viz
* decide whether C++ implementation is needed
